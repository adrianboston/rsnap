# rsnap (rsync-based Time Machine‚Äìstyle backups)

`rsnap` is a lightweight macOS backup utility written in shell script.  
It uses `rsync` and hard links to create efficient, incremental, snapshot-based backups ‚Äî similar in spirit to Time Machine, but simpler and fully transparent. Hardlinks allow you to restore previous versions with minimal disk usage. A full backup will be done every 7 backups.
A key distinction is that rsnap is file-level hard-link snapshots opposed to block0level offered by Time Machine

Block-level snapshots (Time Machine on APFS)

- APFS-only: Block-level snapshots rely on APFS features like copy-on-write and metadata tracking.
- Cannot use on HFS+, exFAT, or network shares that don‚Äôt support APFS snapshots.
- Speed & efficiency: Very fast for large files because unchanged blocks are never copied.
- Limitation: You‚Äôre tied to APFS for both source and destination volumes to get the snapshot magic.

File-level hard-link snapshots (rsnap)

- Filesystem-agnostic: Works on APFS, HFS+, ext4, XFS, etc.
- Mechanism: Hard links to unchanged files; new files or changed files are copied.
- Trade-offs: Slower for huge files that change slightly (entire file is copied if modified).
- Flexibility: Can back up to external drives, network mounts, or any filesystem that supports hard links.

`rsnap` is much more suitable for NAS devices like QNAP or Synology for a few reasons:

Filesystem compatibility

Most NAS devices use ext4, Btrfs, XFS, or network filesystems (SMB/NFS). APFS snapshots won‚Äôt work here, so Time Machine‚Äôs block-level magic is useless. rsnap just relies on file-level hard links, which work fine over these filesystems (or at least over NFS/SMB with some caveats).

Flexibility

You can back up to any mounted volume or network share. You control what to include/exclude with --exclude-from. You can run it from macOS, Linux, or even directly on the NAS (if it has rsync).

Incremental backups

`rsnap` still uses the hard-link + timestamped snapshot pattern, giving the same incremental benefits as Time Machine. On networked NAS, this is critical ‚Äî you don‚Äôt want to copy everything every time.

Logging and scripting

You can add logging, dry-run tests, or scheduling with launchd or cron. You can tweak ulimit, exclude lists, or snapshot frequency for your NAS environment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Incremental backups** ‚Äì unchanged files are hard-linked, saving space.
- **Full backup every 7th run** ‚Äì ensures chain integrity and recovery safety.
- **Automatic snapshot pruning** ‚Äì keeps only the last 7 snapshots.
- **Human-readable snapshot folders** ‚Äì each backup lives in a timestamped directory.
- **Logging** ‚Äì activity and errors are logged to `~/backups.rsync.log`.
- **Portable** ‚Äì no dependencies other than `rsync` (ships with macOS).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

rsnap uses `rsync` to copy files from your source directory to a backup location.  
For each backup, unchanged files are hard-linked to previous snapshots, saving space and speeding up the process. Only new or changed files are copied.

---

## üìã Requirements

- macOS (tested on recent versions) or Linux  
- `rsync` installed (default on macOS)  
- Sufficient permissions to read source and write to backup location  

---

## üöÄ Usage

    ./rsnap.sh -s <source_path> -d <destination_root> -m <VAULT_NAME> [-e <excludes>] [-F <apfs|hfs|unix|fat|ntfs>] [-F] [-S] [-q] [-t]

    ### Command-line Arguments

    - `-s <source_path>`  
        **Source directory** to back up.

    - `-d <destination_root>`  
        **Destination root** where backups will be stored.

    - `-m <VAULT_NAME>`  
        **Vault name** for organizing backups, positioned after above destination root.

    - `-e <excludes>`  
        **Exclude patterns** file (passed to `rsync --exclude-from`).

    - `-F <apfs|hfs|unix|fat|ntfs>`  
        **Filesystem type** for destination which will impact rsync options.

    - `-S`  
        **Safe mode** does not follow and save sym-links

    - `-q`  
        **Quiet mode**; suppresses non-error output.

    - `-t`  
        **Test/dry-run mode**; shows what would happen without making changes.

### Run manually

Example:

    ./rsnap.sh -s $HOME/Documents -d /Volumes/BackupDrive -v MyVault -f hfs -S
   

Backups are created in:

    /Volumes/BackupDrive/Backups.rsnap/MyVault/<timestamp>/

### More Usage Examples

    **1. Backup with exclude patterns**

    Exclude files and folders listed in `exclude.txt`:

    ```sh
    ./rsnap.sh -s ~/Pictures -d /Volumes/BackupDrive -m PhotosVault -e exclude.txt
    ```
    This will skip any files or directories matching patterns in `exclude.txt`.

    ---

    **2. Dry-run (test mode)**

    Preview what would be backed up without making changes:

    ```sh
    ./rsnap.sh -s ~/Projects -d /Volumes/BackupDrive -m CodeVault -t
    ```
    No files are copied; output shows what would happen.

    ---

    **3. Quiet mode**

    Suppress non-error output for silent backups:

    ```sh
    ./rsnap.sh -s ~/Music -d /Volumes/BackupDrive -m MusicVault -q
    ```
    Only errors will be displayed.

    ---

    **4. Safe mode (do not follow symlinks)**

    Back up without following symbolic links:

    ```sh
    ./rsnap.sh -s ~/Documents -d /Volumes/BackupDrive -m DocsVault -S
    ```
    Symlinks are preserved as links, not as the files they point to.

    ---

    **5. Specify filesystem type for destination**

    Optimize rsync options for a FAT-formatted drive:

    ```sh
    ./rsnap.sh -s ~/Downloads -d /Volumes/FATBackup -m DownloadsVault -F fat
    ```
    This adjusts rsync flags for compatibility with FAT filesystems.


### Clone / Download  
Save the script somewhere in your path, e.g.:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rsnap.git
    cd rsnap
    chmod +x rsnap.sh


### Scheduling with launchd  
This section explains how to run `rsnap` automatically on macOS.

**Step 1 ‚Äî Copy the plist**

```sh
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp com.user.rsnap.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.rsnap.plist
```

**Step 2 ‚Äî Load the agent**

```sh
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.rsnap.plist
```

Verify it‚Äôs loaded:

```sh
launchctl list | grep com.user.rsnap
```

**Step 3 ‚Äî Run on demand**

```sh
launchctl start com.user.rsnap
```

**Step 4 ‚Äî Check logs**

```sh
tail -f ~/rsnap.stdout.log
tail -f ~/rsnap.stderr.log
```

**Step 5 ‚Äî Update settings**  
If you edit the plist:

```sh
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.rsnap.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.rsnap.plist
```

**Step 6 ‚Äî Disable or remove**

Disable without deleting:

```sh
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.rsnap.plist
```

Remove completely:

```sh
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.rsnap.plist
```

**Suggestions:**
- Ensure `com.user.rsnap.plist` is correctly configured for your backup schedule and script path.
- Log file paths (`~/rsnap.stdout.log`, `~/rsnap.stderr.log`) should match those specified in your plist.
- Use your actual username or a unique label in the plist filename to avoid conflicts.
- Consider using `launchctl bootout` instead of `unload` on newer macOS versions (Monterey and later).
- For system-wide scheduling, use `/Library/LaunchDaemons` (requires sudo).
- Add a note about editing the plist with `nano` or `vim` if users need to customize it.

Otherwise, the steps are correct and follow standard launchd usage.
